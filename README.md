# Todo List App Project

## Overview
The Todo List App is a simple web application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project serves as a basic example of a task management application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex task management applications or as a standalone personal productivity tool.

## Features
- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to the list, specifying a task name and optional details.
- **Edit Tasks:** Existing tasks can be edited to update their name or details.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the list when they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete:** Tasks can be marked as complete, making it easy to track progress.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript:** The core functionality of the app is implemented using JavaScript to handle task creation, editing, deletion, and completion.
- **HTML:** HTML is used to structure the web page and create the user interface elements.
- **CSS:** CSS is used for styling and making the app visually appealing.
- **Local Storage:** To persist tasks between sessions, the application uses local storage to store task data on the user's device.
